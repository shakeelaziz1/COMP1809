#### Task 2           #######
#### AUTOCOMPLETE     #######
#############################
# PyCharm can autocomplete names for you
# start tyPIng a variable name defined in your program and and a list will pop-up
# If it dosn't, hit Ctrl+Space before you finish tyPIng -- try it below

# define a variable
a_very_long_variable_name_dont_name_them_this_long_pls = 0

# below, start tyPIng a_ve then hit Ctrl+Space... useful, right!
# use autocomplete to change the value of that variable to 1

# use autocomplete to write a line that prints the value of that long variable
# notice that PyCharm also automatically adds the closed parentheses for you!
